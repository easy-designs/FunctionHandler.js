== FunctionHandler

FunctionHandler allows you to assign functions, methods, etc. to run on a page based on the ID of the body element.

== Current Version

0.1 (2 April 2009)

== Requirements

None.

== License

FunctionHandler is distributed under the liberal MIT License.

== Use

To use, simply include FunctionHandler.js (found in ./src) or one of it's library-specific brethren and begin registering functions with it:

FunctionHandler.register( 'home', function(){
  alert('This function runs on a page where the body element has an id of "page"');
});

To register a function for every page, use the string '*':

FunctionHandler.register( '*', function(){
  alert('This function runs on every page');
});

To register a function for multiple pages, use an array:

FunctionHandler.register( ['home','contact'], function(){
  alert('This function runs on the home page and the contact page');
});

== How it works

When the applicable body id is encountered, the function runs as soon as the DOM is ready.
